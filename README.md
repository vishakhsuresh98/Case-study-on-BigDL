# Case-study-on-BigDL
BigDL is a distributed deep learning framework for Apache Spark.

BigDL has been implemented as a standalone library on top of Apache Spark. BigDL has 
been modeled after Torch and it has extensive support for deep learning including numeric 
computing (via tensors) and high-level neural networks. 

This is a case study on the key features, architecture and limitations of BigDL.
